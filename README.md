# P5-template

This package is supposed to be a little helper in starting creative coding with p5.js outside Processing or p5.js Editor. The package exports p5 sketch in [instance mode](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview#instantiation--namespace), so all p5 functions are bound up in a single variable instead of polluting your global namespace `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`. 


## Usage

Clone this repository and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ax2mx/p5-template
cd p5-template
npm install
```

Run script:

```bash
# Start developing with livereload
npm run dev
# or build production bundle
npm run build
```

Enjoy your coding (^-^)
